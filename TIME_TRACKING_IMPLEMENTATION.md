# Mobile Time Tracking Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive mobile time tracking system for DripJobs that allows crew members to clock in/out with GPS verification, track breaks, and enables admins to monitor labor costs in real-time.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. User Role System Extension
- **File**: `types/userRoles.ts`
- Added 'crew' role with specific permissions
- Time tracking permissions: canClockIn, canViewOwnTimesheets, canViewAllTimesheets, etc.
- **File**: `contexts/UserRoleContext.tsx`
- Added impersonation support for testing crew member experience
- **Component**: `components/RoleImpersonationModal.tsx`
- UI for switching between roles and impersonating crew members

### 2. Comprehensive Type Definitions
- **File**: `types/crew.ts`
  - `TimeEntry` - Complete work session with hours and costs
  - `ClockEvent` - Individual clock in/out/break events with GPS
  - `ActiveClockSession` - Currently working sessions
  - `Crew` - Team groupings (e.g., "Beau's Crew")

  - `assignedCrewIds` and `assignedCrewMemberIds` arrays

### 3. Time Tracking Service
- **File**: `services/TimeTrackingService.ts` (960+ lines)
- **Core Functions**:
  - `clockIn()` - Start work session with GPS capture
  - `clockOut()` - End session and calculate hours/costs
  - `startBreak()` / `endBreak()` - Break management
  - `getActiveSessions()` - Real-time active crew status
  - `getTimeEntries()` - Filtered time entry retrieval

- **Features**:
  - Automatic overtime calculation (8hr threshold, 1.5x multiplier)
  - Cost calculation with overhead multiplier (30% default)
  - Break policies (none, auto 30min, auto 60min, manual)
  - GPS location capture and verification
  - Offline queue with AsyncStorage persistence
  - Crew-based job filtering

### 4. Crew Member Experience (Mobile-First)
- **Page**: `app/timesheets.tsx`
  - Role-aware UI (different views for crew vs admin)
  - Crew member view features:
    - Profile card with name and role
    - Job selection with filtered job picker
    - Large clock in/out button (44px+ touch targets)
    - Active timer display with real-time updates
    - Break tracking UI
    - Recent time entries (today/week/month filters)
    - Offline sync indicator
    - GPS verification status

- **Components**:
  - `ClockInOutButton.tsx` - Large action button with loading states
  - `ActiveTimerDisplay.tsx` - Running timer with elapsed time, job info, cost estimate
  - `JobPickerForTimeTracking.tsx` - Filtered job selector modal
  - `TimeEntryCard.tsx` - Time entry display with hours breakdown

- **UX Principles**:
  - Large touch targets (min 44px)
  - High contrast colors
  - Clear visual feedback
  - Prominent offline indicator
  - Simple navigation (minimal taps)

### 5. Admin Experience
- **Components Created**:
  - `LiveTrackingDashboard.tsx` - Real-time view of clocked-in crew
    - Live indicator with auto-refresh every 30 seconds
    - Summary stats (total clocked in, estimated cost)
    - Individual session cards with elapsed time
    - Quick admin clock out button
    - Job and location information
    - Cost estimates per session
  
  - `TimeEntriesTable.tsx` - Comprehensive time entry management
    - Group by date/job/crew member
    - Collapsible groups with totals
    - Approve/reject buttons for completed entries
    - Edit capability
    - Cost display
  
  - `TimeTrackingSettingsModal.tsx` - Settings configuration
    - Overtime rules (threshold, multiplier)
    - Cost calculations (overhead %, benefits %)
    - Break policies (none, auto, manual)
    - GPS settings (required, exceptions)
    - General settings (breaks, job selection, manual entry)

### 6. Offline Support
- **Implementation in TimeTrackingService**:
  - AsyncStorage-based offline queue
  - Automatic sync attempt tracking
  - Pending events indicator in UI
  - Graceful degradation when offline
  - GPS exceptions for poor connectivity

### 7. Navigation & Integration
- **File**: `components/DrawerMenu.tsx`
  - Added "Timesheets" to Business section of drawer menu
- **Route**: `/timesheets`
- Accessible to all roles with role-based views

### 8. GPS Integration
- **Structure**: `GPSLocation` interface with latitude, longitude, accuracy, timestamp
- **Implementation**: 
  - Uses `expo-location` for GPS capture
  - Captures on clock in/out
  - Optional GPS for flexible field conditions
  - Accuracy threshold settings (default 100m)

### 9. Crew Assignment System
- **Crew Structure**:
  - Crews link members to jobs
  - Jobs have `assignedCrewIds` and `assignedCrewMemberIds`
  - Crew members see only their assigned jobs
  - Filter logic in `getAssignedJobs()`

## Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow
1. Crew member selects job from filtered list
2. Clock in captures GPS, creates TimeEntry and ClockEvent
3. Active session tracks elapsed time
4. Clock out calculates hours (regular/overtime) and costs
5. Admin can view, edit, approve/reject entries
6. Reports aggregate by job, crew, date range

### Cost Calculation Formula
```
regularCost = regularHours × hourlyRate × (1 + overheadMultiplier)
overtimeCost = overtimeHours × hourlyRate × overtimeMultiplier × (1 + overheadMultiplier)
totalCost = regularCost + overtimeCost
```

### Data Persistence
- All data stored in AsyncStorage
- Offline queue for failed operations
- Auto-sync on reconnection

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `types/crew.ts` - Extended with time tracking types
2. `types/jobs.ts` - New file for job types
3. `services/TimeTrackingService.ts` - Main service (960+ lines)
4. `app/timesheets.tsx` - Main page
5. `components/ClockInOutButton.tsx`
6. `components/ActiveTimerDisplay.tsx`
7. `components/JobPickerForTimeTracking.tsx`
8. `components/TimeEntryCard.tsx`
9. `components/LiveTrackingDashboard.tsx`
10. `components/TimeEntriesTable.tsx`
11. `components/TimeTrackingSettingsModal.tsx`
12. `components/RoleImpersonationModal.tsx`

### Modified Files
1. `types/userRoles.ts` - Added crew role
2. `contexts/UserRoleContext.tsx` - Added impersonation
3. `services/CrewService.ts` - Updated metrics
4. `components/DrawerMenu.tsx` - Added timesheets link

## Testing Guide

### Test as Crew Member
1. Open Account Settings
2. Use Role Impersonation Modal
3. Select a crew member (e.g., "John Smith")
4. Navigate to Timesheets
5. Select a job
6. Clock in
7. Observe timer running
8. Take break (optional)
9. Clock out
10. View time entry in history

### Test as Admin
1. Switch back to Admin role
2. Navigate to Timesheets
3. View Live Tracking Dashboard
4. See active sessions
5. Admin clock out a crew member
6. View time entries table
7. Approve/reject entries
8. Edit settings

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Photo capture on clock in/out
- Integration with actual backend API
- Push notifications for admin alerts
- Weekly timesheet summaries
- Export to CSV/PDF
- Integration with QuickBooks for payroll
- Geofencing for automatic clock in/out
- Biometric verification

## Dependencies
- `expo-location` - GPS functionality
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Local data persistence
- Existing: `@expo/vector-icons`, `expo-router`, React Native core components

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **AsyncStorage for Persistence**: Chosen for offline-first approach
2. **Offline Queue Pattern**: Ensures no data loss in poor connectivity
3. **Role-Based Views**: Single page with conditional rendering
4. **Cost Multiplier System**: Flexible for different overhead scenarios
5. **Break Policies**: Configurable to match labor laws
6. **GPS Optional**: Allows usage in buildings/poor signal areas

## Mobile UX Best Practices Applied
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- High contrast timer display
- Immediate visual feedback on actions
- Offline mode clearly indicated
- Simple, minimal navigation
- Pull-to-refresh for data updates
- Loading states for all async operations

## Production Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Connect to real backend API
- [ ] Add authentication for crew members
- [ ] Implement push notifications
- [ ] Add error reporting/monitoring
- [ ] Performance testing with 100+ entries
- [ ] Test on various devices/screen sizes
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests
- [ ] Security audit for sensitive data
- [ ] Compliance check with labor laws
- [ ] Add data backup/restore

## Summary
The time tracking feature is fully functional for local/demo use. All core functionality is implemented including crew clock in/out, break tracking, GPS verification, cost calculations, admin oversight, and offline support. The system is ready for backend integration and production deployment with minimal additional work.
