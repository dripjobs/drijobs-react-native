### Understanding Sync Status

#### Synced ‚úÖ
**What it means:** Entity successfully synced to QuickBooks

**What to do:**
- Nothing required
- QuickBooks ID available for reference
- Can verify in QuickBooks using ID

**Example:**
```
Status: Successfully synced to QuickBooks
Last Synced: 2 hours ago
QuickBooks ID: 123
```

#### Pending üïê
**What it means:** Entity waiting to sync based on configured schedule

**What to do:**
- Wait for auto-sync to complete
- If pending > 1 hour, report to admin
- Check that auto-sync is enabled

**Example:**
```
Status: Waiting to sync to QuickBooks
Queued: 5 minutes ago
```

#### Error ‚ö†Ô∏è
**What it means:** Sync failed, needs attention

**What to do:**
1. Click badge to view error details
2. Common errors and fixes:
   - **"Duplicate name exists"**: Customer name already in QuickBooks
     - Solution: Admin needs to rename or merge customers
   - **"Customer not found"**: Referenced customer doesn't exist
     - Solution: Sync customer first, then retry invoice
   - **"Invalid reference"**: Referenced entity ID invalid
     - Solution: Admin needs to fix reference
   - **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Too many API calls
     - Solution: Wait 1 minute, retry automatically

3. Document error and report to admin

**Example:**
```
Status: Sync failed
Error: Duplicate Name Exists Error
Detail: A customer with this name already exists
```

#### Not Synced ‚≠ï
**What it means:** Entity intentionally not synced yet

**What to do:**
- For proposals: Normal until job starts
- For other entities: May indicate disabled sync
- Verify this is expected

**Example:**
```
Status: Not synced to QuickBooks
Reason: Will sync when job starts
```

### Common Reconciliation Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Missing Invoice in QuickBooks
**Problem:** DripJobs shows invoice as "Synced" but not in QuickBooks

**Steps:**
1. Get QuickBooks ID from sync badge
2. Search QuickBooks by ID (not invoice number)
3. If still not found:
   - Check you're in correct QuickBooks company
   - Check invoice not deleted in QuickBooks
   - Report discrepancy to admin

#### Scenario 2: Amount Mismatch
**Problem:** Invoice amount differs between DripJobs and QuickBooks

**Steps:**
1. Check last sync timestamp
2. If recently updated, wait for next sync
3. If old sync, report discrepancy
4. Admin may need to force re-sync

#### Scenario 3: Payment Not Applied
**Problem:** Payment shows synced but invoice still shows balance in QuickBooks

**Steps:**
1. Get payment QuickBooks ID from badge
2. Find payment in QuickBooks
3. Check if payment linked to invoice
4. If not linked:
   - Admin may need to manually apply in QuickBooks
   - Or delete and re-sync from DripJobs

#### Scenario 4: Duplicate Customers
**Problem:** Multiple customers in QuickBooks for same business

**Steps:**
1. Identify all duplicate customer IDs
2. Check DripJobs for duplicate business records
3. Report to admin to:
   - Merge customers in QuickBooks
   - Update DripJobs to reference correct ID
   - Delete duplicate business in DripJobs

### Best Practices

#### For Accuracy
1. **Reconcile daily** - Don't let errors accumulate
2. **Use QuickBooks IDs** - More reliable than names
3. **Document discrepancies** - Keep detailed notes
4. **Report promptly** - Don't wait for month-end

#### For Efficiency
1. **Learn sync badge colors** - Quick visual scan
2. **Bookmark common screens** - Faster navigation
3. **Use filters** - Focus on specific entities
4. **Export regularly** - Keep offline records

#### For Communication
1. **Be specific** - Include entity IDs and error messages
2. **Include screenshots** - Visual reference helps
3. **Suggest solutions** - Based on error type
4. **Set expectations** - Sync timing, resolution time

### Limitations to Be Aware Of

1. **Read-Only Access**
   - Cannot fix errors directly
   - Must communicate with admin for changes

2. **Sync Timing**
   - Auto-sync may have delays
   - Not always real-time
   - Hourly/daily sync based on settings

3. **Proposal Timing**
   - Proposals don't create invoices immediately
   - Only when job status changes
   - This is intentional for accrual accounting

4. **Customer Hierarchy**
   - Businesses are parents, contacts are children
   - Understand this when reconciling
   - Invoices may be under contact, not business

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why can't I edit records?**
A: Accountant role is read-only to prevent accidental changes. Request admin to make edits.

**Q: Why do some invoices show "Not Synced"?**
A: Proposals don't create invoices until the job starts. This is intentional for accrual accounting compliance.

**Q: How often does data sync?**
A: Depends on settings. Usually real-time, but may be hourly or daily. Check with admin.

**Q: Can I disconnect QuickBooks?**
A: No, only admins can manage QuickBooks connection settings.

**Q: Why are contacts sub-customers?**
A: This follows QuickBooks best practice for B2B relationships. It allows multiple contacts per business while maintaining proper hierarchy.

**Q: What if I need to export data?**
A: Currently, take screenshots or manually export from QuickBooks. Future versions will include export features.

**Q: Can I see who made changes?**
A: Audit logs show sync activities. User-level tracking would be in full multi-user implementation.

**Q: How do I switch back to admin?**
A: Only admins can switch roles. Log in as admin account.
