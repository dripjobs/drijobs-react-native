```typescript
POST /api/websites - Create website
GET /api/websites/:id - Get website details
PUT /api/websites/:id - Update website
POST /api/websites/:id/generate-content - AI content generation

```

  - Business type and location
  - Years in business
  - Unique value propositions
  - Primary services
  - Target customers

Update the `generateContent` method in `WebsiteService.ts` to connect to your AI provider.

## Template Variable System

Templates use Handlebars-style variables:
- `{{business_name}}` - Business name
- `{{hero_headline}}` - AI-generated headline
- `{{primary_color}}` - Brand color
- `{{phone}}` - Contact phone
- `{{services}}` - Array of services (use with `{{#each services}}`)
