## üöÄ Integration Guide

### Stripe Integration (for Card Payments)

The card payment flow is ready for Stripe integration. See the main implementation guide for details, but here's a quick overview:

```typescript
// Replace the mock processing in handleProcessPayment()
// with actual Stripe API calls:

const { error, paymentIntent } = await stripe.confirmPayment(clientSecret, {
  paymentMethodType: 'Card',
  paymentMethodData: {
    billingDetails: {
      name: cardholderName,
    },
  },
});
```

### Receipt Sending Integration

Currently, receipts are simulated. To implement:

```typescript
// In completePaymentLogging(), replace the Alert with:

if (receiptViaEmail) {
  await sendEmail({
    to: invoice.contactEmail,
    subject: message.subject,
    body: message.body,
  });
}

if (receiptViaText) {
  await sendSMS({
    to: invoice.contactPhone,
    message: message.body,
  });
}
```
