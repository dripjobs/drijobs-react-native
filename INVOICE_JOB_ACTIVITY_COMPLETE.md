## Test Data Updates

### app/invoices.tsx
Added to business invoices (INV-1011, INV-1012, INV-1013):
- **Job Information**:
  - Job address
  - Salesperson name
  - Start/end dates
  - Crew or team member
- **Activity Log**:

  - Invoice sent activity (if not draft)
  - Payment received activity (if paid)
- **Deal Metadata**:
  - Deal stage: "Proposal Stage"
  - Deal amount: 120% of invoice amount
  - Deal probability: 75%

## Files Modified
1. `components/InvoiceDetail.tsx` (main implementation)
2. `app/invoices.tsx` (test data)

## DateTimePicker Implementation
- Three separate pickers to avoid state conflicts:
  1. Scheduled sending (existing): `showDatePicker` + `scheduledDate`
  2. Invoice due date: `showDueDatePicker` + `editingDueDate`
  3. Payment request due date: `showPaymentRequestDueDatePicker` + `paymentRequestDueDate`
- All use native DateTimePicker component
- Platform check: Only render on non-web platforms
- Minimum date constraint on all pickers

## Tab Order Update
**New Order**:
1. Overview
2. Items
3. Payments
4. Stakeholders (business invoices only)
5. **Activity** (NEW)
6. Settings

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Better Context**: Job info provides project/work context directly on invoice
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete activity log for compliance and tracking
3. **Time Precision**: Timestamps now include time for better tracking
4. **Deal Navigation**: Direct access to related deals from invoice
5. **Flexible Due Dates**: Both invoice and payment request due dates are editable
6. **Professional Appearance**: Secure payment indicator now looks trustworthy, not alarming
7. **Consistent Design**: Deal cards match existing chat interface design

## Technical Notes
- All new components follow existing design patterns
- Conditional rendering ensures backward compatibility
- Activity log supports both populated and empty states
- DateTimePickers properly isolated to prevent state conflicts
- Test data covers multiple invoice states (draft, sent, paid)
- Styles maintain consistency with existing invoice components

## Future Enhancements (Ready for Implementation)

2. Activity log auto-population from invoice actions
3. Real-time activity updates
4. Activity filtering/search
5. Export activity log
6. Deal details expansion in contact modal
