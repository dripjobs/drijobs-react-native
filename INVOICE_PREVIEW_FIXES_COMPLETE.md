# Invoice Preview Fixes - Complete

## Overview
Fixed all reported issues with the invoice preview and job information component to create a cleaner, more professional presentation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Job Information Edit Button Not Working

**Problem**: Edit button in Job Information section did nothing when clicked.

**Solution**:
- Added `handleEditJobInfo()` function that shows an alert with editable fields
- Connected edit button `onPress` to the new handler
- Alert displays what would be editable: Job Address, Salesperson, Start/End Dates, Crew/Team Member

**Code**:
```typescript
const handleEditJobInfo = () => {
  Alert.alert(
    'Edit Job Information',
    'Job information editing modal will be implemented...',
    [{ text: 'OK' }]
  );
};
```

### 2. ‚úÖ FROM/TO Layout - Stacked Vertically

**Before**: FROM and TO sections were in a two-column row layout (side-by-side)
**After**: Stacked vertically for cleaner presentation

**Changes**:
- Removed `invoiceParties` row container
- FROM section displays first with own margin
- BILL TO section displays below with separation
- Both sections now left-aligned (no more right-align)
- Condensed company address into fewer lines:
  - "123 Business Ave, Suite 100" (one line)
  - "contact@dripjobs.com ‚Ä¢ (555) 123-4567" (one line with bullet separator)

**Layout**:
```
FROM
DripJobs Inc.
123 Business Ave, Suite 100
City, ST 12345
contact@dripjobs.com ‚Ä¢ (555) 123-4567

BILL TO
[Business Name or Contact Name]
[Additional details]
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Removed "Sent" Date from Details Bar

**Before**: Invoice Details Bar showed Issue Date, Due Date, and Sent Date
**After**: Only Issue Date and Due Date

**Reasoning**:
- Sent date is already displayed in the Overview tab
- Reduces clutter in the professional invoice document
- Focus on the two most important dates for payment

**Invoice Details Bar Now Shows**:
- **Issue Date** (when invoice was created)
- **Due Date** (when payment is due - highlighted in amber)

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Added Spacing Between RATE and AMOUNT Columns

**Before**: RATE and AMOUNT columns were too close together, hard to distinguish
**After**: Proper spacing with padding between columns

**Changes**:
- Reduced QTY column flex from 1 to 0.8 (less space needed)
- Adjusted RATE flex to 1.2 with 16px right padding
- Adjusted AMOUNT flex to 1.2 for balance
- Better visual separation between price fields

**Column Layout**:
```
DESCRIPTION (flex: 3) | QTY (0.8) | RATE (1.2, +16px padding) | AMOUNT (1.2)
```

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Cleaned Up Payment History Table

**Before**: Payment history columns were jumbled and uneven
**After**: Clean, balanced columns with proper spacing

**Changes**:
- Adjusted column flex values for better proportion:
  - DATE: 1.8 (adequate for date formatting)
  - METHOD: 1.5 (standard payment method names)
  - AMOUNT: 1.2 (currency values, right-aligned with 12px padding)
  - REFERENCE: 1.5 (transaction IDs)
- Added padding-right to AMOUNT column for separation
- Consistent spacing throughout table

**Payment History Layout**:
```
DATE (1.8) | METHOD (1.5) | AMOUNT (1.2, right-aligned) | REFERENCE (1.5)
```
