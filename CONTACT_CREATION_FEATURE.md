## Technical Implementation

### State Management
The modal manages state including:
- Current step (1-3)
- Contact data (name, email, phone, company, title)
- Address data (street, city, state, zip, country)
- Additional data (lead source, notes)
- Form validation errors
- UI states (saving, focused input)

### Focus Management
Tracks which input is currently focused for proper highlighting:
```typescript
const [focusedInput, setFocusedInput] = useState<string | null>(null);

onFocus={() => setFocusedInput('firstName')}
onBlur={() => setFocusedInput(null)}
```

### Form Reset
Comprehensive reset function clears all state when:
- Contact is successfully created
- User discards changes

### Contact Creation
Creates a complete contact object including:
- Basic info (name, email, phone)
- Secondary contact methods
- Company and title
- Full address
- Lead source
- Notes
- Timestamps
- Initial empty arrays for deals, proposals, etc.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/components/CreateContactModal.tsx` - Main contact creation modal component

### Modified Files
- `/app/(tabs)/contacts.tsx` - Added integration for contact creation
  - Imported CreateContactModal and UserPlus icon
  - Added showCreateContact state
  - Added createContactButton to header with UserPlus icon
  - Added CreateContactModal to render tree with onContactCreated callback
  - Added headerButtons and createContactButton styles
  - Opens contact detail card after creation

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In contacts.tsx
const [showCreateContact, setShowCreateContact] = useState(false);

// In header render
<View style={styles.headerButtons}>
  <TouchableOpacity 
    style={styles.createContactButton}
    onPress={() => setShowCreateContact(true)}
  >
    <UserPlus size={22} color="#FFFFFF" />
  </TouchableOpacity>
  <TouchableOpacity 
    style={styles.headerButton}
    onPress={() => setShowFilterModal(true)}
  >
    <Filter size={24} color="#FFFFFF" />
  </TouchableOpacity>
</View>

// In modal render
<CreateContactModal 
  visible={showCreateContact}
  onClose={() => setShowCreateContact(false)}
  onContactCreated={(contact) => {
    setSelectedContact(contact);
    setShowContactCard(true);
  }}
/>
```

## Styling Approach

- Consistent color scheme with the app (Purple/Indigo primary)
- White cards with subtle shadows for depth
- Blue accents for selected/active states
- Purple focus states for inputs
- Red for errors
- Green for success states (create button)
- Responsive spacing and typography
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44 points)

## Accessibility Considerations

- Clear labels for all form fields
- Error messages are descriptive
- Visual feedback for all interactions
- Adequate color contrast
- Touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44)
- Keyboard navigation friendly
- Optional fields clearly marked
