  };

  proposalId?: string;
  convertedAt?: string;
}
```

#### B. Add One-Off Badge to Header

    <Text style={styles.oneOffBadgeText}>One-Off</Text>
  </View>
)}
```

## üí° Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Multi-step flow** - Breaks complex form into digestible steps
2. **Reusable patterns** - Mirrors proposal creation flow for consistency
3. **Optional addresses** - Reduces friction for quick invoice creation
4. **Recurring flexibility** - Multiple end types (never/after/on date)
5. **One-off indicator** - Clear visual distinction from job-based invoices

### User Experience:
- **Step indicator** shows progress through creation
- **Back/Next navigation** allows easy flow control
- **Form validation** prevents submission errors
- **Info banners** clarify invoice type and purpose
- **Search functionality** for quick existing customer selection

### Technical Notes:
- Modal uses React Native's native Modal component
- Date pickers use @react-native-community/datetimepicker
- Form state managed with single object for easier validation
- Mock data provided for existing customers (replace with API calls)
- Success callback allows parent to handle invoice creation response
