## ðŸš§ REMAINING TASKS

### 9. Tab Navigation Updates (TODO)

- Add "Salesperson Permissions" tab (similar to crew permissions)
- List all salespeople with current permission levels
- Allow admins to change salesperson permission levels
- Show permission level descriptions and capabilities
- Color-coded level badges
