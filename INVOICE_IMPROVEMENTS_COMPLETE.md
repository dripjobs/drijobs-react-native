## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. **components/InvoiceDetail.tsx**

#### Interface Updates
- **JobInfo interface:** Split `jobAddress` into `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`. Changed `teamMember` (singular) to `teamMembers` (array of `{name, role}`).
- **Invoice interface:** Added `scheduledSendDate?: string` field.

#### New State Variables
```typescript
// Address fields
const [editAddressLine1, setEditAddressLine1] = useState('');
const [editAddressLine2, setEditAddressLine2] = useState('');
const [editCity, setEditCity] = useState('');
const [editState, setEditState] = useState('');
const [editPostalCode, setEditPostalCode] = useState('');

// Team members
const [editTeamMembers, setEditTeamMembers] = useState<Array<{name: string, role: string}>>([]);
```

#### New Tabs
- Added `'integrations'` tab to activeTab type
- Added integrations tab to tabs array with RefreshCw icon

#### New Imports
- `List`, `RefreshCw` from lucide-react-native

#### 1.1 Scheduled Send Banner
**Location:** Immediately after SafeAreaView opening (line 872-897)

**Features:**
- Shows when `invoice.scheduledSendDate` exists and `invoice.sentAt` is undefined
- Displays scheduled send date/time using `formatScheduledTime()` utility
- Amber/yellow warning styling
- Cancel button with confirmation dialog
- Full-width banner at top of page

#### 1.2 Job Information Modal Improvements

**Edit Button (Line 1131-1136):**
- Changed from button with icon + text to icon-only button
- Uses new `editIconButton` style
- Increased icon size from 16 to 20

**Job Info Display (Lines 1147-1152):**
- Updated to display formatted address:
  ```
  123 Main St, Apt 2
  Springfield, CA 94102
  ```
- Updated team members display to show array with name and role

**Modal Address Fields (Lines 3525-3605):**
- **Street Address Line 1:** Required field for street address
- **Apt/Suite Line 2:** Optional field with helpful placeholder
- **City, State, ZIP Row:** Three fields in a row
  - City: 2x flex width
  - State: 1x flex, 2 char max
  - ZIP: 1x flex, number pad, 10 char max

**Team Members Section (Lines 3753-3788):**
- Shows when `jobAssignmentType === 'individual'`
- "Add Member" button (syncs from Job Schedule)
- List of current team members with name, role, and remove button
- Help text: "Team members sync from Job Schedule"

**Handler Functions:**
```typescript
handleAddTeamMember() // Shows alert about Job Schedule sync
handleRemoveTeamMember(index) // Removes team member from array
handleEditJobInfo() // Initializes all new address fields properly
```

#### 1.3 Integrations Tab
**Location:** Lines 1920-2063 (between stakeholders and activity tabs)

**Features:**
- **Sync Summary Card:**
  - Green success styling
  - QuickBooks logo placeholder
  - Connection status
  - Last sync timestamp

- **Sync Timeline:**
  - **Invoice Creation:** Shows invoice number, sync time, creator, "View in QuickBooks" link
  - **Line Items Sync:** Lists all items with quantities/prices, sync timestamp
  - **Payment Syncs:** Each payment with method, amount, transaction ID, "View in QuickBooks" link
  - **Invoice Sent:** Tracked event with timestamp

- **Sync Actions:**
  - "Force Sync Now" (indigo button)
  - "View Sync Logs" (gray button)

**Styling:** Professional timeline design with icons, color-coded status indicators, and clear hierarchy.

#### 1.4 Invoice Preview Number Formatting

**Table Header (Lines 5044-5047):**
```typescript
flex: 3    // Description
flex: 0.7  // QTY (reduced from 0.8)
flex: 1.3  // RATE (increased from 1.2, added paddingRight: 16)
flex: 1.5  // AMOUNT (increased from 1.2)
```

**Table Rows (Lines 5051-5059):**
- Added `numberOfLines={2}` to description
- Added `numberOfLines={1}` to rate and amount (prevents wrapping)
- Proper alignment for all columns

**Totals Section Updates:**
```typescript
totalsRows: {
  width: '55%',  // Increased from 50%
  minWidth: 320, // Increased from 300
}

// All value fields:
flexShrink: 0,  // Prevents text shrinking
```

**Result:** 6-digit numbers like `$54,252.22` display properly without wrapping to multiple lines.
