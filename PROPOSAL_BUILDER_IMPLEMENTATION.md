## Design Patterns

### Mobile-First UI
- **Horizontal scrolling tab bar** for easy navigation between sections
- **Bottom sheet modals** for forms (Add Item, Deposit, Discount)
- **Touch-friendly buttons** with proper spacing and sizing
- **Card-based layout** for better organization on small screens
- **Gradient header** consistent with app design language

### Color Scheme
- Primary: `#6366F1` (Indigo)
- Secondary: `#8B5CF6` (Purple)
- Accent: `#A855F7` (Pink)
- Success: `#10B981` (Green)
- Warning: `#F59E0B` (Amber)
- Error: `#EF4444` (Red)
- Gray scale for text and backgrounds

### Typography
- Header titles: 18-20px, bold (700)
- Section titles: 16-18px, semibold (600)
- Body text: 14-16px, regular (400)
- Labels: 14px, medium (500-600)

## Implementation Notes

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState) for local state management
- Proposal data passed via URL params when editing
- Real-time calculations for totals, deposits, and balances

### Calculations
```typescript
const subtotal = lineItems
  .filter(item => !item.isOptional)
  .reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.totalPrice, 0);

const totalAmount = subtotal - discountAmount + taxAmount;

const depositAmount = depositRequired
  ? (depositType === 'amount' 
      ? depositValue 
      : (totalAmount * depositValue) / 100)
  : 0;

const remainingAmount = totalAmount - depositAmount;
```

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface ProposalLineItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  quantity: number;
  unitPrice: number;
  totalPrice: number;
  isOptional: boolean;
}

interface ProposalMilestone {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  amount: number;
  dueDate: Date;
  isCompleted: boolean;
  percentage: number;
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No backend integration yet** - Currently all data is local state
2. **Date pickers not functional** - Need to implement date picker modals
3. **Form validation missing** - No input validation implemented
4. **No image/file uploads** - Attachments not implemented
5. **Production rates tab incomplete** - Complex feature needs full implementation
6. **Customer data mock** - Not pulling from actual customer records

## Design Comparison with Desktop

The mobile version successfully adapts all key desktop features:

✅ **Fully Implemented:**
- Line items management
- Optional items
- Proposal summary
- Discount system
- Deposit settings
- Payment schedule (milestones)
- Terms and conditions
- Multiple note types
- Tab navigation
- Header actions

⏳ **Partially Implemented:**
- Settings tab (basic fields only)
- Comments (structure only)
- Activity log (structure only)
- Video content (structure only)
- Presentation wizard (structure only)

❌ **Not Yet Implemented:**
- Production rates & areas
- Packaged pricing

- Rich text editor (using plain text)

## Mobile-Specific Enhancements

1. **Touch Optimized**: All interactive elements sized for finger input
2. **Bottom Sheet Modals**: Better UX on mobile than full-page modals
3. **Horizontal Tab Scrolling**: Space-efficient navigation
4. **Collapsible Sections**: Manage long forms on small screens
5. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Important info stands out
6. **Responsive Layout**: Works on various mobile screen sizes

## Conclusion

The mobile proposal builder provides core functionality needed to create and edit proposals on mobile devices. The foundation is solid, with clear patterns for extending functionality. The UI follows mobile best practices and maintains consistency with the existing app design.

Next development should focus on backend integration and completing the modal interactions to make the builder fully functional.
