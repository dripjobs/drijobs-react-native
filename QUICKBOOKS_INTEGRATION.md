# QuickBooks Online Integration Guide

## Overview

The DripJobs QuickBooks Online integration provides seamless synchronization of customers, invoices, payments, and recurring jobs between DripJobs and QuickBooks Online. This integration follows accounting best practices and is designed to meet the needs of bookkeepers and accountants.

## Features

### 3. Payment Synchronization
- **Immediate Sync**: All payments sync immediately for accurate cash flow tracking
- **Invoice Linking**: Payments are automatically linked to their corresponding invoices
- **Payment Methods**: Supports multiple payment methods

### 4. Recurring Jobs

  - ‚úÖ **Synced**: Successfully synced to QuickBooks
  - üïê **Pending**: Waiting to sync
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error**: Sync failed

## Understanding the Customer Hierarchy

### Business as Parent Customer
When you create or update a business in DripJobs:
- The business is created as a **parent customer** in QuickBooks
- Company name, address, and contact details are synced
- The business remains the top-level entity for billing

### Contacts as Sub-Customers
When you create or update a contact linked to a business:
- The contact is created as a **sub-customer** in QuickBooks
- The contact is linked to the parent business customer
- Invoices can be issued to the sub-customer while rolling up to the parent

### Primary Contact
- Each business should have a designated **primary contact**
- The primary contact is used for billing information
- This ensures consistent billing across multiple jobs for the same business

## Invoice Creation Workflow

### Proposal Accepted ‚Üí No Immediate Invoice
When a proposal is accepted in DripJobs:
1. The proposal is stored locally in DripJobs
2. **NO invoice is created in QuickBooks yet**
3. The proposal status shows as "Accepted" but "Not Synced"

### Job Starts ‚Üí Invoice Created
When the job status changes to your configured trigger (e.g., "In Progress"):
1. DripJobs checks if the business exists in QuickBooks (creates if needed)
2. Checks if the primary contact exists as sub-customer (creates if needed)
3. Creates the invoice in QuickBooks linked to the sub-customer
4. Stores the QuickBooks Invoice ID locally
5. Updates the sync status badge to "Synced"

### Why This Approach?
- **Accrual Accounting Compliance**: Revenue is recognized when work begins, not when contracted
- **Cash Flow Accuracy**: Prevents premature revenue recognition
- **Bookkeeper-Friendly**: Aligns with standard accounting practices

## Payment Synchronization

### Immediate Sync
All payments are synced immediately when recorded:
1. Payment recorded in DripJobs
2. Finds or creates customer in QuickBooks
3. Finds linked invoice in QuickBooks
4. Creates payment record in QuickBooks
5. Links payment to invoice
6. Updates local record with QuickBooks Payment ID

### Payment Types
- One-time payments
- Progress payments
- Final payments
- Refunds (marked as credit memos)

## Accountant/Bookkeeper Access

### Creating Accountant Access
1. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Account Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations**
