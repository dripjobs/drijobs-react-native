# Invoice Bug Fixes and Stakeholders Tab - Implementation Complete

## Overview
This document summarizes all bug fixes and the new stakeholders tab feature that have been implemented for the invoice detail component.

## Bug Fixes

### 1. ✅ Fixed Recipient Icon Alignment
**Issue:** Icon appeared above "Robert Johnson" instead of beside it in the recipients section

**Fix:**
- Added missing `contactCard` style with `flexDirection: 'row'` and `alignItems: 'center'`
- Added `contactCardInfo`, `contactCardName`, and `contactCardEmail` styles
- Ensured proper horizontal layout with gap spacing

**Location:** `components/InvoiceDetail.tsx` ~2290-2296, Styles ~6149-6171

**Styles Added:**
```typescript
contactCard: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
  alignItems: 'center',
  gap: 12,
  backgroundColor: '#F9FAFB',
  padding: 14,
  borderRadius: 10,
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: '#D1D5DB',
}
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed DateTimePicker Spacing
**Issue:** Poor spacing between "Select Time" label and send button

**Fix:**
- Added `marginTop: 12` and `marginBottom: 20` to `scheduleSection` style
- Provides proper visual separation between schedule options and action buttons

**Location:** `components/InvoiceDetail.tsx` Styles ~6233-6237

**Updated Style:**
```typescript
scheduleSection: {
  gap: 12,
  marginTop: 12,
  marginBottom: 20,
}
```

**Note:** DateTimePicker z-index and text color issues are React Native platform-specific. The component is rendered natively and styling is handled by the OS. For production, consider:
- Using a custom date picker component
- Testing on actual devices for visibility
- Adjusting modal background opacity if needed

---

### 3. ✅ Fixed Deal and Proposal Navigation
**Issue:** View Deal and View Proposal buttons showed alerts instead of navigating

**Fixes:**

**View Deal:**
- Now navigates to `/(tabs)/team-chat` (deal command center)
- Ready for deal-specific routing when deal ID parameter is supported
- Commented code shows future implementation: `router.push(\`/(tabs)/team-chat?dealId=\${invoice.relatedDealId}\`)`

**View Proposal:**
- Now navigates to `/proposal-builder?id=${invoice.relatedProposalId}`
- Opens the specific proposal in the proposal builder
- Only enabled when `relatedProposalId` exists

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// View Deal
onPress={() => {
  if (invoice.relatedDealId) {
    router.push('/(tabs)/team-chat');
  }
}}

// View Proposal
onPress={() => {
  if (invoice.relatedProposalId) {
    router.push(`/proposal-builder?id=${invoice.relatedProposalId}`);
  }
}}
```

**Location:** `components/InvoiceDetail.tsx` ~868-899
